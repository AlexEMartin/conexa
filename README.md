Please proceed as follows:

- git clone 'repo url' (to the location of your choice)
- Once inside the project, run `npm install` and `npm run dev` to install dependencies and start the project. Remember to click on the provided port in the console.


- Small issue: When comparing episodes of both characters, it may happen that if either of them does not appear in the first 20 episodes, no comparison is possible. This is because the API documentation provides a method that fetches the first 20 episodes, so to implement the entirety of the series, it would be necessary to manually paginate it.
